reverse singly linked list
By using three pointers:
class Solution(object):
 def reverse(self, head):
   """
   input: ListNode head
   return: ListNode
   """
   # write your solution here
   prev = None
   curr = head
   while curr != None:
     next = curr.next
     curr.next = prev
     prev = curr
     curr = next
   head = prev
   return head


By using recursion
class Solution(object):
 def reverse(self, head):
   """
   input: ListNode head
   return: ListNode
   """
   # write your solution here
   if not head or not head.next:
     return head
   new_head = self.reverse(head.next)
   head.next.next = head
   head.next = None
   return new_head
